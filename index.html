	<div id="infotekst">
	<p>We have considered the UN's twelfth sustainability goal, Responsible consumption and production.<br><br>
	The idea we have chosen is that consumers should be able to scan the barcode of all goods that allow it and then be told whether the product they want to buy is sustainable or not. We want this to be an app, so that it becomes easily accessible.<br><br>

	We have chosen to call it ECO HELPMATE. With this application it should be easier for you and me, to act sustainably! That way, everyone, regardless of age, can help us stay within our ecological footprint.</p>
